\section{Selected Research Projects}

\cventry{2018-Present}{Many-Core Scalability for Existing File Systems}{}{}{}{As storage devices become significantly faster and processors become increasingly parallel, parallelizing file system operations becomes even more important to achieve high throughput for applications. However, most operations on today's popular file systems do not scale well on multi-core processors. For example, non-conflicting operations like directory listing, file creation, deletion, and renaming scale poorly only after 10 cores even on fastest storage devices.In this regard, we aim to design file system that could scale all non-conflicting operations without any hardware support.}
\cventry{2017-Present}{Automatically Eliminating False Sharing for Improving Concurrency }{}{}{}{Parallel programs on shared memory multiprocessors suffer from a slowdown of an order of magnitude due to false sharing. False sharing occurs when multiple threads demand exclusive access to a cache line even though their data locate on non-overlapping portions of the cache line. In this project, we proposed a profile-guided false sharing repair mechanism that also improves spatial locality. Our proposed approach groups memory locations accessed by identical threads and places different groups into separate cache lines to repair false sharing.}
\cventry{2017-2018}{Feedback Directed Parallelization for Heterogeneous Systems}{}{}{}{Assigning computations to the correct processing unit is difficult because performance on heterogeneous systems maybe dominated by subtle effects that are hard to measure or anticipate through static analysis. In this project, we leveraged performance monitoring unit counters  to predict a computation's performance on different machines.}
\cventry{2013-2017}{Performance Analysis for Multi-Radio Cognitive Radio Networks}{}{}{}{In this project, we analyzed several performance metrics (throughput, delay, packet-loss, etc.) in multi-radio cognitive radio networks. Consequently, we proposed a feedback-based multi-radio exploitation approach to overcome throughput degradation in multi-radio cognitive
radio networks.}
