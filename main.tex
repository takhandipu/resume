\section{Selected Research Projects}

\cventry{2020-Present}{Profile-guided Binary Layout Optimization for Linux Kernel}{}{}{}{Many data center applications suffer from frequent instruction cache misses costing millions of dollars. While existing profile-guided optimization mechanisms can improve the instruction locality of user-mode instructions for these applications, no such technique exists for kernel-mode instructions. In this work, we first characterize the high percentage of instruction cache misses coming from kernel model instructions. Then, we enhance the state-of-the-art profile-guided optimization tool, BOLT to rewrite the Linux Kernel binary.}
\cventry{2019-Present}{Context-Driven Conditional Instruction Prefetching with Coalescing for Data Center Applications}{}{}{}{Modern data center applications exhibit large instruction footprints, leading to frequent instruction cache misses increasing cost and degrading data center performance and energy efficiency. To overcome this performance degradation via prefetching, we first investigate the challenges of effective instruction prefetching. We then use insights derived from our investigation to develop I-SPY, a novel profile-guided prefetching technique. Specifically, I-SPY proposes context-driven conditional prefetching and prefetch coalescing. For nine data center applications, I-SPY provides an average of 15.5\% speedup and 95.9\% reduction in instruction cache misses outperforming the state-of-the-art prefetching technique by 22.5\%.}
\cventry{2019-Present}{Performance Characteristics of Managed Workloads}{}{}{}{Many modern applications are written in managed code to achieve type safety, portability, security, and automatic memory management. While these features provide necessary abstractions for quick and safe software development, computer architectural aspects of these features are not well studied in the literature. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of these managed workloads. We identify the key bottlenecks that significantly hurt the performance of these workloads on modern hardware. We also correlate these bottlenecks on different aspects of managed runtime including common shared libraries, garbage collection, and just in time code generation.}
\cventry{2018-Present}{Continuous Locality Optimization}{}{}{}{Locality of reference is a key factor affecting a program's performance. However, very few programs exhibit good data locality during execution. In this project, we propose Erie, the first methodology that can continuously monitor executions in production for locality optimizations, with negligible overhead and without requiring special hardware. Using a hybrid approach, Erie efficiently identifies locality problems in production, and addresses them in house. Erie can reason about how its optimizations affect unobserved executions, as well as their interaction with underlying hardware mechanisms. Our evaluation shows that Erie's overhead is less than 1.36\% on average, and its optimizations provide up to 53.14\% (16.83\% on average) speedup, compared to a baseline that uses the highest level of compiler optimization. Erie provides up to 17.48\% (6.64\% on average) speedup on PostgreSQL, one of the most popular open-source data-base management systems.}
\cventry{2017-2019}{Automatic False Sharing Elimination}{}{}{}{Parallel programs on shared memory multiprocessors suffer from a slowdown of an order of magnitude due to false sharing. False sharing occurs when multiple threads demand exclusive access to a cache line even though their data locate on non-overlapping portions of the cache line. In this project, we proposed Huron, a hybrid in-house/in-production false sharing detection and repair system. Huron detects and repairs as much false sharing as it can in-house, and relies on its lightweight in-production mechanism for remaining cases. The key idea behind Huron's in-house false sharing repair is to group together data that is accessed by the same set of threads, to shift falsely-shared data to different cache lines. Huron's in-house repair technique can generalize to
  previously-unobserved inputs. Our evaluation shows that Huron can detect more false sharing bugs than all state-of-the-art techniques, and with a lower overhead. Huron improves runtime performance by 3.82$\times$ on average (up to 11$\times$), which is 2.11-2.27$\times$ better than the state of the art.}
%\cventry{2017-2018}{Feedback Directed Parallelization for Heterogeneous Systems}{}{}{}{Assigning computations to the correct processing unit is difficult because performance on heterogeneous systems maybe dominated by subtle effects that are hard to measure or anticipate through static analysis. In this project, we leveraged performance monitoring unit counters  to predict a computation's performance on different machines.}
\cventry{2013-2017}{Performance Analysis for Multi-Radio Cognitive Radio Networks}{}{}{}{In this project, we analyzed several performance metrics (throughput, delay, packet-loss, etc.) in multi-radio cognitive radio networks. Consequently, we proposed a feedback-based multi-radio exploitation approach to overcome throughput degradation in multi-radio cognitive
  radio networks.}
